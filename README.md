_________________________________________

This are my notes for the KodeKloud course by Mumshad Mannambeth, **Ansible for Absolute Beginners.**

I intend to document all the learning that I'll acquire here. This will serve as my *foundation* notes for Ansible and I hope this will also be useful to anyone who's also taking the course, or simply to anyone who just stumbled on this repo.

If you're interested on learning more about this course or if you'd like to explore the included hands-on labs, you can check out the following links:

- [Ansible for the Absolute Beginner - Hands-On - DevOps](https://www.udemy.com/course/learn-ansible/)

And oh, one last thing, the date's 2021-01-23. I'm targeting to finish this by 2021-01-30.

I'll be posting updates soon.

**UPDATE - 2021-01-25**

So I was actually able to finish all 10 sections of the course in a matter of 2 days and I'm left with just the final project which is a single deployment of a LAMP stack application.

**My experience so far.** I have to mention that I did have a brief introduction and short hands-on in Ansible when I took the pre-selected sections of the CBT Nuggets DevNet Associate Course so I had sort of an idea of the basics and how Ansible works. Having said, i still enjoyed how this KodekLoud course has touched some seemingly small aspects of Ansible which are actually important concepts to remember.

Feels like this course is the ultimate supplementary to the Ansible crash course section of DevNet.

Once I'm done with the project, I'll try to challenge myself by creating a playbook which does all the steps required defined in the project.
